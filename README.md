![banana](.github/banana.png)

A minimal window manager

</div>

## building

This should be self explanatory but if you don't know how then run this to build & install.

```bash
make release; sudo make install
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## configuration

Configuration is done at `$HOME/.config/banana/banana.conf`, this file will be automatically
created if it doesn't exist, all available configuration options exist in this file already.
All options are self explanatory and don't need documentation, if you can't figure it out,
then this window manager might not be for you.
